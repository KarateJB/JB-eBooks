## Introduction

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a quick and popular website hosting service for the [Github](https://github.com/) repositories. We are going to deploy our website to Github Pages with `Angular CLI`.


## Environment

* Angular CLI 1.0.0-beta.19.3


## How to deploy


#### Create Github Repository

Of course we should have a Github repository and push our project codes.


#### Build and Deploy

You can quickly deploy the website in `Angular CLI` by this command.

```
ng github-pages:deploy --message "Commit message"
```

The command will create a new branch: `gh-pages`, which will store the build output files.

But before your deploy, notice that

1. The projectâ€™s name should as same as the name of the Github repository.

2. We have to commit and push current changes on the project codes.



After successfully deploying the project, now we can browse it on
{Github_id}.github.io/{repository_name}
