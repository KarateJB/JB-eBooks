# Introduction

Evolving plan (逐步形成之計畫) from initiation to closure, based on

1. Goal
2. Values
3. Risks
4. Constraints
5. Stakeholder feedback
6. Review findings


## Difference between Predictive planning and Adaptive planning

### Predictive Planning

1.  Project is successful when the plan is met, and the deliverables are as planning.
2.  Plan depends on the stability of requirements.
3.  Process first.

### Adaptive Planning

1.  Requires evolutionary design.
2.  People first.


# Concept

## Team

1.  Maintain a prioritized backlog.
2.  Have close collaboration with the customer.
3.  Deliver a working, tested increment after each iteration.
4.  Welcome to change and respond.
5.  Consistent staff.


## R&R (Roles and Responsibilities)

| <center>Role</center> |  <center>Responsibility</center>  |
|:----------------------|:----------------------------------|
| PO/Customer           | 1. Define and prioritize requirement<br>2. Define release goal and iteration goal |
| (Development)Team     | 1. Define velocity<br>2. Co-work with PO/Customer |
| Scrum master/XP Coach | 1. Check if team follow Agile processM<br>2. Support the team’s need |

# Value-based analysis

## Delivery MMF/MVP

1. MMF: Minimum Marketable Feature

> A release is a collection of MMFs.
> 
> Objective: **Selling**

2. MVP: Minimum Viable Product

> MVP is a product which has just enough features to gather validated learning and continued development
>
> Objective: **Learning from market**

# Innovation games

Goal:

1. Identify customer requirement
2. Improve retrospectives
3. Prioritize backlogs
4. Create better release plans

## Design a Product Box 

### Me and my shadow

1. Identify customer's hidden needs
2. Watch what they do and ask why
3. Record key activities by camera or ...


### Speed boat

1. The boat is the System
2. The features they dislike are Anchors

### Remember the Future

1. Understand the customer's definition of success
2. Customer write down what they image the product's future


### Buy a feature

1. Create a list of features with a price for each. Price is based on development costs, customer value.
2. By customer buying the feature, we can prioritize the features (product backlog) 


### Prune the product tree (For better release plans)

Develop better release plans to shape the product for market.


### Timebox planning



### Rolling wave planning and Progressive elaboration

As the project progress, we can identify the risks, assumptions and milestones more reliable and clear.

### Exploratory testing (Learn from testing it)

Test as experiments.

# Agile Estimation

## Who should do the estimation

Development team

## What is Story Point

1. A number how hard a User Story is, related to complexity, unknowns and efforts
2. Usually Fibonacci series (1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,45) or a modified one (1,2,3,5,13,40,100)
3. Relative, not actual working time.


## How to estimate

1. Find a baseline story

2. Use one of the following estimation techniques

    * Planning poker
    * T-shirt sizing
    * Wideband Delphi
    * Ideal time
    * Affinity estimating
    * Velocity

# Planning Levels

## Product Vision

1. Elevator statement
2. Product box

## Product Roadmap

1. Communicate
2. Determine when releases are needed
3. Determine what functions are sufficient for each release
4. Focus on business value from the release


## Release Plan

1. Release with `Date`, `Theme`, `Planned feature set`
2. Typical interval: **2 - 4 months**


## Iteration Plan

**Iteration 0**: Spike, setting environment

**Last iteration**: Fixing bugs, refactoring...


## Daily Commitment

1. Iteration backlog to Task, estimate every task
2. A feature is not done until it is tested, meet the DoD and accepted by PO
3. Daily stand-up meetings
